# Data Science Portfolio - Martins Nnamchi

__Hello there!__

Welcome to my data science playground! I'm a data enthusiast with a knack for turning numbers into stories and patterns into insights. With a flair for machine learning and a love for all things data, I'm here to explore, innovate, and, most importantly, have fun with data! Dive in to see how I blend analytical rigor with a dash of creativity to solve real-world problems!

 This project demonstrates the application of Large Language Models, specifically Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, to perform celebrity identification in images using Python. An upload interface is provided using IPyWidgets to test the functionality.

In this project, I explored time series and regression for renewable-energy forcasting. I developed XGBOOST-trained ML models to predict the amount of wind energy that can be generated over a period. I deployed the model using FLASK, creating an interactive web app that delivers real-time energy predictions. This project kickstarts my learning in time series analysis and end-to-end model development/deployment.

In this project, I predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The predictions will help determine launch costs and aid operational planning. I implement Dash/Plotly Interactive Dashboards, REST APIs, Web scraping, SQL queries, Data Wrangling/Preprocessing, EDA, and ML pipeline development.

In this project, I built models that predict if a financial transaction is fraudulent or not, aiming to enhance credit card security. I model the task as a binary classification problem and implement SVM and DT models using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

In this project, I employ supervised classification models to predict rainfall in Australia. Four different classification models were implemented: K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression model exhibited the best performance, with a prediction accuracy of 84%.
