In this project, I predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The predictions will help determine launch costs and aid operational planning. I implement Dash/Plotly Interactive Dashboards, REST APIs, Web scraping, SQL queries, Data Wrangling/Preprocessing, EDA, and ML pipeline development.

In this project, I built models that predict if a financial transaction is fraudulent or not. I model the task as a binary classification problem. I implement SVM and DT models and model the classification task using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

In this project, I employ supervised classification models to predict rainfall in Australia. Four different classification models were implemented: K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression model exhibited the best performance, with a prediction accuracy of 84%.

A hybrid-filtering personalized news articles recommendation system which can suggest articles from popular news service providers based on reading history of twitter users who share similar interests (Collaborative filtering) and content similarity of the article and user’s tweets (Content-based filtering).

In this project I have used models such as RNN, LSTM, 1D-CNN to predict the engine failure 50 cycles ahead of its time, and calculated feature importance from them using sensitivity analysis and shap values. Exponential degradation and similarity-based models are also used to calculate its remaining life.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/960x0.jpg"> **[Wind Turbine Power Curve Estimation](https://github.com/archd3sai/Wind-Turbine-Power-Curve-Estimation)**

In this project, I have employed regression techniques to estimate the Power curve of an on-shore Wind turbine. Nonlinear trees based regression methods perform best as true power curve is nonlinear. XGBoost is implemented and optimized using GridSearchCV which yields lowest Test RMSE-6.404.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/phase1.jpg"> **[Multivariate Phase 1 Analysis](https://github.com/archd3sai/Multivariate-Phase-1-Analysis)** 

Objective of this project is to identify the in-control data points and eliminate out of control data points to set up distribution parameters for manufacturing process monitoring. I utilized PCA for dimension reduction and Hotelling T2 and m-CUSUM control charts to established mean and variance matrices.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/gdp.jpg"> **[What's the GDP of India?](https://github.com/archd3sai/Predicting-GDP-of-India)**

Objective of this project is to perform predictive assesment on the GDP of India through an inferential analysis of various socio-economic factors. Various models are compared and Stepwise Regression model is implemented which resulted in 5.7% Test MSE.

In this project I applied various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and LightGBM to detect consumers who will default the loan. SMOTE is used to combat class imbalance and LightGBM is implemented that resulted into the highest accuracy 98.89% and 0.99 F1 Score.
