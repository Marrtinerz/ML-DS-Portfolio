# Data Science Portfolio - Martins Nnamchi

__Hello World!__

Welcome to my DS/ML portfolio. Here, you'll find a curated, constantly improved selection of my projects, highlighting my expertise/growth in data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and computer programming. Through these projects, I demonstrate my ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights and actionable strategies. Whether itâ€™s through predictive modeling, data visualization, or natural language processing.

In this project, I predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. The predictions will help determine launch costs and aid operational planning. I implement Dash/Plotly Interactive Dashboards, REST APIs, Web scraping, SQL queries, Data Wrangling/Preprocessing, EDA, and ML pipeline development.

In this project, I built models that predict if a financial transaction is fraudulent or not. I model the task as a binary classification problem. I implement SVM and DT models and model the classification task using both Scikit-Learn and Snap ML.

In this project, I employ supervised classification models to predict rainfall in Australia. Four different classification models were implemented: K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression model exhibited the best performance, with a prediction accuracy of 84%.

## Micro Projects
- ### Data Collection & Vizualization
    - [Stock Data Extraction and Visualization Using REST APIs and Webscraping](https://github.com/Marrtinerz/Python_Projects/tree/master/Stock_Data_Analysis): This Python program simulates a car dealership's inventory management system. The system aims to model cars and their attributes accurately.
    - [Car Dealership's Inventory Management System](https://github.com/Marrtinerz/Python_Projects/tree/master/ManagementSystem): In this file, I explored how bayesian statistics works and how prior assumption reflects posterior probabilities using Gun control example. 
    - [Chicago Dataset SQL Querying](https://github.com/Marrtinerz/SQL-Projects/tree/master/Chicago_Dataset_Sql_Querying): In this file, I attempt to comprehensively understand three Chicago datasets using SQL queries and %sql magic.
